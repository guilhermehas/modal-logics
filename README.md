Agda formalisation associated to the paper "Dual-context Calculi
for Modal Logic." A preprint can be found at

<https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04860>

Contains basic metatheoretic results about dual-context calculi
(e.g. admissibility of weakening, contraction, cut) as well as
proofs of equivalence with the relevant Hilbert systems (up to
provability only).
